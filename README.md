# Cloud DevOps - Final Lab

## Introduction

If you're building and deploying cloud native applications and microservices, then understanding container development and orchestration is a must have skill.

In this Lab you'll learn how to use both Docker and Docker Compose to build and run containers.

In this Lab scenario you'll work with 3 containers:

* React (front-end)
* Express (Back-end)
* Mongodb

This Lab will teach you how to use use Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, to configure and launch the Full Stack (front-end , Back-end , db) environment.


Upon completion of this Lab, you will be able to:

Use a Dockerfile to create a web application

Use the docker compose command to launch a multi-container setup
Test and validate the container setup using the curl command
